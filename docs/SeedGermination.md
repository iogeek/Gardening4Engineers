# Seed Germination

## Seeds

-   Sharing seeds with friends and family.

    -   Beans, chard pumpkin (2)

    -   Increase variety with same money

    -   Seeds only last a few seasons

-   Different Germination needs

    -   Beans -\> 70F

        -   Chard -\> overnight soak

        -   Pumpkin -\> long maturity (ie start soon)

## Use stuff from home

-   take out containers

-   Be creative

-   wash before using with regular soap.

-   Wash at the end of the season

## Soil Block

-   Germinating in pots vs pods

    -   No right / wrong

    -   Pod use less soil / water / space

    -   Move into pot if germination is successful otherwise toss

-   Jiff pellet vs DIY dome

-   Jiffy

    -   soak pellet

-   DIY Block maker

    -   1 inch pvc, cap, bolt, fender washer, and 2 nuts

    -   Peat needs to be the consistency of peanut butter

    -   Remove any twig debris

    -   start with a cup of peat and mix/stir in water until you get the peanut
        butter consistency

    -   making blocks

        -   pull up bolt on block maker

        -   fill pvc with material

        -   flip over and push down on bolt to form pod

        -   plant seed in pod

## Spacing

-   SFG vs traditional row

-   SFG is mostly used for home

    -   Reduce space needed

    -   Similar benefits as container gardening

    -   Pathway every 4 feet as max comfortable reach is 2 feet

-   Row gardening (industrial)

    -   Allow for machines to travel down rows to tend plants

    -   Rows are for drainage and irrigation
