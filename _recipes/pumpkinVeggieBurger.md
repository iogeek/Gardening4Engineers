ingredients:
  porridge oats: 1kg
  condensed milk: 400g
  soft brown sugar: 500g
  butter: 500g
instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to 150C fan.
  - Line a large baking tin with baking parchment (my tin measures 39cm x 26cm).
  - Melt the butter and sugar in a large pan over a low heat. Don't cook the butter, just warm it enough to melt it.
  - Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the condensed milk.
  - Mix in the oats until well coated by the mixture.
  - Pour into the baking tin and smooth out with the back of a large spoon.
  - Cook for about 15-20 minutes. When the flapjack starts to brown around the edges of the tin, take it out of the oven - it should still be relatively pale in the middle.
  - Leave to cool for a few minutes before cutting into pieces.
