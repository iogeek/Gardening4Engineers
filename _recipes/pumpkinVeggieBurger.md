ingredients:
  - 1 cup oats
  - 1 (15.5 oz.) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
  - 1 cup pure pumpkin purée Robbie’s homegrown is best :) 
  - 1 cup cooked quinoa (or cooked brown rice)
  - 1/2 cup diced red onion
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 stalk celery, diced
  - 1 tablespoon hot sauce (optional)
  - 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce (optional)
  - 1 teaspoon salt
 -  1 teaspoon cumin
  - 1 teaspoon fresh thyme
  - 1 teaspoon fresh sage
  - 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to 150C fan.
  - Line a large baking tin with baking parchment (my tin measures 39cm x 26cm).
  - Melt the butter and sugar in a large pan over a low heat. Don't cook the butter, just warm it enough to melt it.
  - Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the condensed milk.
  - Mix in the oats until well coated by the mixture.
  - Pour into the baking tin and smooth out with the back of a large spoon.
  - Cook for about 15-20 minutes. When the flapjack starts to brown around the edges of the tin, take it out of the oven - it should still be relatively pale in the middle.
  - Leave to cool for a few minutes before cutting into pieces.

This recipe makes enough flapjack for two hungry children for several weeks of school lunches.
