Seed planning (to me) is figuring out the best combination of what to grow, when you want it, and where will it grow best.  I loosely follow the principles behind (Square Foot Gardening)[https://squarefootgardening.org/].  Below are tips and tools collected over time.

# Space
- This will make sure you don't waste time and seed by overseeding.  Square foot gardei\
  - viabilibity for the microclimiate your garden is in
# Harvest dates
  - Show dates and spacing harvests according to what can be eaten.  I started with a simple spreadsheet and as the garden grew built custom software to help manage the tasks.
# Journal
 Notes from last year (if this has been planted before)
  - Apply the learning to  

Seed  pellets and paper pots.
