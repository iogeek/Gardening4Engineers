# Using seed packet information for planning 
Seed packets contain a lot of information that can be used for garden planning.

## Time considerations....  Can I grow it?
- Days to germination - Time for seeds to sprout under ideal conditions. 
- Days to harvest / maturity -  Time from once planted/adjusted to first fruit / vegtable under ideal ideal conditions. <br>

<br>

Using a tomato as an example:
    7 days to germination
    14 days to transplant size
    14 days for plant to adjust to soil
    48 days to harvest
    Total: 83 days from seed to harvest vegetable
This pretty helpful for timing (including succession planting)and seeing if there is enough growing season. The times are not exact but tend to be good enough for planning purposes.

Look up the typical frost dates for where you live (example: First frost is October 1 and last frost is April 17th for my area).

To calculate the earliest and latest I plant this vegetable I would do the following.

**Last day to germinate**

Count back 83 days from first frost date. Example: October 1 minus 83 days = July 10.
 
 If you are using spreadsheet, formula for this is<br>
 ```=DATE(YEAR(TODAY()),10,1) -83```

**First day to germinate**
If you wanted to have the plants ready at the earliest  time (ie start conditioning them for transplant after frost has cleared) then count back germinate time (7 days) and seedling time (14 days) from the last frost date.  Example: April 17 - 21 days = March 27.
 
 If you are using spreadsheet, formula for this is<br>
 ```=DATE(YEAR(TODAY()),4,17) - 21```

So you have from March 27 to July 10 to germinate this variety.

## Other care instructions
- Sowing or planting tips (some seeds need to be soaked over night)
- Thinning and transplanting
- Shade and sun tolerance.
