The pvc grid idea was found on [DavesGarden](https://davesgarden.com/community/forums/t/1414441/). It provides accurate watering when coupled with a automated sprinkler and provides great visuals for the planting sqaures.

Each 4x4 grid needs the following
- 18 pvc lengths measuring 10-3/4"
- 6 pvc lengths measuring 9-1/4" 
- 2 pvc lengths measuring 2-1/2" 
- 9 cross connectors ![pvc cross]({{ site.imagePath | relative_url }}/pvcCross.jpg){:height="48px" width="48px"}
- 2 elbows 90&deg; ![pvc elbow]({{ site.imagePath | relative_url }}/pvc90elbow.jpg){:height="48px" width="48px"}
- 1 PVC Reducer Male Adapter 3/4" MNPT x 1/2" Slip ![pvc reducer]({{ site.imagePath | relative_url }}/pvcReducerMNPT-Slip.jpg){:height="48px" width="48px"}
- 2 Male Slip Adapter 1/2" x 1/2" ![pvc adapter]({{ site.imagePath | relative_url }}/pvcMaleSlipAdapter.jpg){:height="48px" width="48px"}
- 2 1/2" Threaded cap ![pvc threaded cap ]({{ site.imagePath | relative_url }}/pvcThreadedCap.jpg){:height="48px" width="48px"}
- 9 Slip on PVC caps ![pvc cap]({{ site.imagePath | relative_url }}/pvcSlipCap.jpg){:height="48px" width="48px"}

I used 1/2" PVC for the project and it worked will with my 3/4" water hose (note: this is why there is a 3/4" to 1/2" reducer)
