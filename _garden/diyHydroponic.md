Hydroponics is another of my "let's learn" journeys. Kudos to the University publications (links at the end) and [Master Gardeners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_gardener_program) which have provided tips and guidance over the years.

# Documenting my learning
If you can read only one article, read [University of Florida blog](https://blogs.ifas.ufl.edu/orangeco/2020/04/09/set-it-and-forget-it-hydroponics/).  Start small and iterate.  Keep a journal to document you successes. There is a lot of figure out  (lighting, nutrients, leaks, clogs, etc). 

[Oklahoma State](https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/hydroponics.html) has a great primer of the different types of hydroponic systems.

# First setup - water culture
 
![water culture system]({{ site.imagePath | relative_url }}/hydroponics/waterCulture.jpg)

## Building it
- 3" net cups - a 3.5" plant pot can be used if holes are drilled to allow for water flow
- "rough tote" bins
- aquarium bubbler
- Air line
- Air pump
- Light source : T5 fluorescent 6500k or "Full" spectrum

## Results
Setup in the greenhouse during winter with lettuce and basil.   Basil would sprout but cold air stressed the leaves.  Lettuce faired well and produced... albeit slowly.  I did not track length to maturity, but it was noticeably longer.  Overall the system worked but required heat mats to overcome the cold.  The increased greenhouse temp and lack of aphid predators provided a different challenge.<br>

# Second setup.  drip system
![drip system]({{ site.imagePath | relative_url }}/hydroponics/drip.jpg)

## Building it
- 3" net cups 
- PVC fence post sleeve.  Can also use 4" PVC drain pipe.
- Alternate setup was with a concrete mix tub
- 1/2" bung adapter for drain
- 1/2" pvc and 1/2" drip line with 1/4" emitters
- Light source : the sun :)

## Results
Setup outdoors with lettuce and basil.  System produced well.  Birds and other wildlife seemed to love the water supply and would introduce leaks as they interacted with the exposed water.

# Third setup - Aeroponics 
My outdoor lettuce / basil system sprays the roots from below.

Problems I avoided:
- Lighting expense.  No charge to use the the sun. 

Problems I continue to have:
- Leaking.  My mitigation is regular checks and planting strawberries underneath the hydroponics.  
- Clogging misters - Mitigation is  spot checks and the occasional cleaning of a nozzle.

# Nutrients
I purchase commercial nutrient mixes.  Ingredients between brands are inconsistent.  To help understands the nutrients your setup will need, typing "hydroponic recipe edu" into your browser should bring up some peer reviewed publications.
