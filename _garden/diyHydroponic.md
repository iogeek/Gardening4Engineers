# Starting hydroponics
As this is documenting my setup, I do caution folks to start small.  It has taken a few attempts to figure out a system that works for me.  Keep in mind hydroponics adds the complexity of figuring out a nutrient solution that works for your plants while not clogging your setup plus a setup that works in your environment.  

My first setup was a simple bucket similar to https://blogs.ifas.ufl.edu/orangeco/2020/04/09/set-it-and-forget-it-hydroponics/.   I would strongly recommend starting small / simple and grow as comfort / confidence increases.
