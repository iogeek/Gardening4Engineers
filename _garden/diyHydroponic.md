# Documenting my hydroponic setup
Before building your own hydroponics, I encourage folks to start with something small and simple.  My first setup was a simple bucket similar to [University of Florida blog](https://blogs.ifas.ufl.edu/orangeco/2020/04/09/set-it-and-forget-it-hydroponics/).  There is a lot of figure out  (lighting, nutrients, leaks, clogs, etc). 

# My first setup
 

[Oklahoma State](https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/hydroponics.html) has a great primer of the different types of hydroponic systems.

# Picking a nutrient mix
I purchase commercial nutrient mixes.  Ingredients between brands are inconsistent.  To help understands the nutrients your setup will need, typing "hydroponic recipe edu" into your browser should bring up some peer reviewed publications. 

# Aeroponics worked for me
My outdoor lettuce / basil system sprays the root system from below.

Problems I avoided:
- Lighting expense.  My hydroponic is outside thus 

Problems I continue to have:
- Leaking.  My mitigation is regular checks and planting strawberries underneath the hydroponics.  
- Clogging misters - Mitigation is  spot checks and the occasional cleaning of a nozzle.
