# Documenting my hydroponic setup
Before building your own hydroponics, I strongly encourage to start with something small and simple.  My first setup was a simple bucket similar to [University of Florida blog](https://blogs.ifas.ufl.edu/orangeco/2020/04/09/set-it-and-forget-it-hydroponics/).  There is a lot of figure out  (lighting, nutrients, leaks, clogs, etc). 

[Oklahoma State](https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/hydroponics.html) has a great primer of the different types of hydroponic systems.

# My first setup
 First setup was a "water culture system" using a rough tote container and an aquarium bubbler.

## Results
I set this up in a greenhouse during winter.  The system worked but required heat mats to overcome the cold.  The increased greenhouse temp and lack of aphid predators provided a different challenge.

# Second attempt.  A drip system
 Outdoor drip system

## Building it

## Results
System produced well.  Birds and other wildlife seemed to love the water supply and would introduce leaks as they knocked drip tubes away from  plants.

# Picking a nutrient mix
I purchase commercial nutrient mixes.  Ingredients between brands are inconsistent.  To help understands the nutrients your setup will need, typing "hydroponic recipe edu" into your browser should bring up some peer reviewed publications. 

# Third attempt - Aeroponics for the outdoors
My outdoor lettuce / basil system sprays the roots from below.

Problems I avoided:
- Lighting expense.  No charge to use the the sun. 

Problems I continue to have:
- Leaking.  My mitigation is regular checks and planting strawberries underneath the hydroponics.  
- Clogging misters - Mitigation is  spot checks and the occasional cleaning of a nozzle.
