Repurposed clear plastic gallon milk jugs. 

Poke drainage holes in the bottom with scissors or something like a heated ice pick. Cut containers horizontally at least 4-inches from the bottom and discard the bottle caps.
Gather your seeds and write the plant�s name and date planted on the container with a permanent marker. Also put a marked tag, such as a Popsicle stick inside each container.
When planting begins in the spring it will reduce the confusion if your labels include a hint about where they go in the garden (sun or shade, wet or good drainage, etc.).
Fill the bottom of each mini-greenhouse with loose soil such as commercial potting soil. Many people mix their own out of garden dirt, sand, compost and perlite.
Wet the soil and let it drain. Tiny seeds that need light to germinate are pressed into the top of the soil and seeds that need dark to germinate are pressed into the soil.
Secure the top of the greenhouses with tape. It does not have to be a perfect seal but you want it to hang together through rain, freeze, warm days and wind.
Put the containers in a sunny spot where rain and snow can enter through the top. During periods of no rainfall, bottom water the greenhouses by putting them into a plastic and pouring water � not freezing cold water � into the pan. When the soil has absorbed enough water to be moist not wet, drain the saucers.

supplies
• Empty, clean gallon jugs
• Box Cutter Knife
• Small Ice Pick or Power Drill
• Seeds (I recommend Botanical Interests)
• Seed Starter Mix
• 5-gallon Bucket
• Something to stir the mixture with (I use a paint stick)
• Small Hand Shovel
• Water (tap is fine)
• Permanent Marker & Duct Tape

Milk Jug Greenhouse Directions
Now that you have all the supplies you will need, here are my step-by-step directions to make the greenhouses. This is exactly how I make them every year. I’ve been doing this for seven years now.

• Save and clean milk jugs or water jugs for a few weeks prior to planting. You will need one jug per variety of plant you are growing.

• Cut the top off the milk jugs with a box cutter knife. Leave one side of the top attached, so the jug has a “lid.” I recommend making the cut about 2/3 of the way up the container. If you cut too low you won’t have enough room for the seed starting mix.

• Puncture the bottom of the jug with several small holes for drainage. I used a small ice pick to do this. You could also use a power drill. Anywhere from 6-12 holes per jug is good. Set the jugs aside.

• Next, pour the seed starter mix into the 5-gallon bucket. Add water a little at a time and stir the mixture until all of the seed starter mix is moist (think brownie batter) but not sopping wet or dripping. Be sure to use a seed starter mix and NOT soil from your yard or garden. If you are starting a lot of seeds at once you may need more than one bag of seed starter.

• Transfer the mixture to each jug using the small hand shovel. I suggest filling each jug with at least 2-inches of the mixture to allow room for root growth. Then plant your seeds, one variety per jug, according to the directions on each seed packet. Most packets have a seed starting guide on them. Please note: If the packet recommends direct sow only (such as for carrots) those seeds are best to plant after your frost date and NOT in the milk jug.

• Bend the “lid” back over the jug to close it. Seal each jug with duct tape. Label the jugs with a permanent marker and leave the cap lids off the jugs. I recommend labeling the tape and/or jug in more than one area.

DIY Milk Jug Greenhouse – Winter Sowing

DIY Milk Jug Greenhouse , Winter Sowing

Winter Sowing – have you heard of it? Basically, for those in colder climates, it’s magic says my friend Heather from Massachusetts.

Here’s what she had to say about the winter sowing and the milk jug greenhouses she made:

Milk Jug Greenhouse




It works like this: around January through March it’s time to make little tiny greenhouses from see-through milk jugs. Place your moistened soil and little seeds in there and seal it up. Then simply put it outside {without a lid} and let nature with all of it’s rain, snow, ice and wind do it’s thang.

Come pre-springtime your seeds will freeze and thaw as if they were out in the wild outdoors but we get the benefit of plants getting a head start and protection from the crisp air. Come springtime during the day open the lids for sunshine and air, be careful to close at night. When it’s time to plant your seedlings, put them directly into the garden – Mother Nature has already hardened them off.

Light: while many seeds don’t require light to sprout, once they emerge from the soil they’ll need plenty of sunlight or artificial lighting to grow big and strong.
Air: Plant root systems need light, fluffy soil and room to breathe oxygen. If your seed starting space is too crowded or the soil is compacted or ultra-wet, the airflow will be compromised and your plants won’t be very happy.
Nutrients: Most seed starting soil mixes contain all the nutrients your baby plants need before they’re to be transplanted.
Temperature: plants have different temperature ranges within which they sprout or thrive. Tomatoes and eggplants, for instance, like it hot, while greens like kale and cabbage may become stunted in sweltering conditions.

Pros and Cons:
A DIY method like this one has a variety of advantages and disadvantages:

Pros

Budget-friendly
Environmentally-conscious
No hardening-off required
Plants produced this way are hardier
Little monitoring required
Cons

Requires some setup
It also requires lots of patience!

supplies
Milk jugs (opaque or clear are both fine options)
Quality seeds
Sturdy scissors or a serrated knife
Duct tape
Labeling supplies of your choice (must be waterproof)
A high-quality potting soil mix- not a seed starting mix

Steps:
Here’s a breakdown of how to start your seeds in milk jugs

Cut the milk jug in half using a knife or scissors. Don’t cut through the handle. Keep it intact to act as a hinge. Toss the cap, you won’t need it.
Add drainage holes to the bottom of the container.
Pre-moisten the soil.
Sow the seeds inside the jug. Read the seed packet info carefully and follow guidelines to ensure you sow to the proper depth.
Move the top half of the milk jug back in place and tape up the container making sure there are no gaps anywhere along the cut line. If air gets in (cold air, in particular) this method won’t work.
Label or find a way to identify each jug so you’re not confused later on.
Place the completed mini-greenhouses in a sunny spot outside.

You may need to water from time to time, just keep an eye on your jugs and don’t let them dry out. Once the plants have at least 4 true leaves, you can remove them from the milk jug

Instructions for making and using a Milk Jug Greenhouse indoors:
// Wash your milk jugs. Keep the lid.
// Cut around the jug about 3-4 inches from the bottom. leaving the back 1/4 attached (use it as a hinge). Be sure you leave the handle intact.
// Fill it with 2″ of potting soil. No need to cut holes in the bottom if you are growing these inside.
// Place your seeds inside. I soaked mine for 1 hour and placed them extra close together for Microgreens. You can also space them out for future transplanting. A half gallon jug can probably handle about 9 pea seeds.
// Tamp the seed down a bit.
// Cover your seeds with another shallow layer of potting soil. The bigger the seed the thicker the soil. Don’t fill it higher than your cut sides.
// Water in your seeds but don’t water them so much they are “swimming” in moisture. A good dampening will do.
// Close the top and put tape around the jug to keep the moisture in your milk jug greenhouse.
// Re-cap your mini greenhouse to keep in the moisture.
// Place your milk jug greenhouse in a south or east facing window and check it every few days. Spray water inside if needed. You are aiming for moist, but not soaking.
// After a few days you should see your seeds sprouting .
// Depending on the type of seed you are using, they should be ready for garden transplanting or Microgreens in 14 days.
